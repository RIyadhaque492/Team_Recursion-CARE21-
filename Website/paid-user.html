                    <h3>Bethany Wissler</h3>
                    <h4>Actress</h4>
                    <p>Bethany began taking acting classes and having small parts in theater plays when she was around 6 years old. This really helped her social skills and gave her a desire to be involved in other things. She began cheerleading in the second grade and met her BFF Grace. She continued to cheer and became the first special needs person to be on the High School team. She got involved in different activities with her friend Grace during high school including being in the senior play. She was also the first special needs person to be voted homecoming queen at Whitmer High School. After graduation she got a job as a hostess at The Outback Steakhouse working part time. After about a year working she decided to keep her job but also to go to the University of Toledo through their T-square program. Grace was already attending there too so together they both joined the RockeThon committee. After weeks of practice dancing and raising money they attended the 14 hour day of the RockeThon. She had so much fun, never getting tired. At the end of the night they choose one college boy to be Mr. RockeThon and one girl to be Miss RockeThon. Out of all those students they choose Bethany to be Miss RockeThon. She was so excited. After one year of college Bethany decided she wanted to take acting classes at Starbound Talent Agency. She continues to work, helps in the community and dreams of going to Hollywood and being an actress or a singer.</p>

                    <p>Through the years Katie McNamee has volunteered at Acme Supermarkets and Senior Nursing Centers but from the young age of 13, Katie’s dream job has always been something involving music. After working very hard for the past year with a non-profit organization All Together Now Music, Katie has finally had her dream come true!

                        She worked very hard for the past year not only singing her own songs but also writing her own lyrics for the songs! To our knowledge, there is not anyone out there with Down Syndrome who has accomplished this wonderful feat! Katie’s CD is titled Power Of The Music and was released on April 27th, 2019! It is available for download at <a href="https://www.alltogethernowmusic.com/katie" style="text-decoration: none; color: blue;">www.alltogethernowmusic.com/katie</a> where you can also find a music video that was put together. In her spare time, Katie volunteers at a social program for developmentally delayed young adults named Kate’s Place, a program that was started in her honor </p>

                    <h4>NBA TEAM EQUIPMENT MANAGER</h4>
                    <p>I am excited to celebrate one year as an equipment team member with the NBA basketball team, The New Orleans Pelicans.
                        I had worked for 18 years at a grocery store and a year and a half ago, I decided it was time for me to change from a job to a career that I really would enjoy. As an NDSS SAAB board member I was advocating for #DSWORKS® so I needed to practice what I preached and go for my dream job.
                        I had experience with the sports equipment team during junior and high school. I applied for a position with the Pelicans, had an interview and on 9/5/17 joined the staff of the Pelicans. Every day, I look forward to a new adventure with the Pelicans. I work with equipment, stock team and staff lockers, wash towels and, the best part, do shootarounds with the Pelican team. What a dream come true. I am treated exactly the same as other staff members. I appreciate the opportunity the NOLA Pelicans have given me and I work really hard to demonstrate ability.</p>

                    <h3>David Egan</h3>
                    <h4>ADVOCATE</h4>
                    <p>Employment is a defining aspect of adult life. It connects us to full participation and inclusion in our communities; it fosters a sense of self-worth, opens opportunities for social growth, and leads to greater independence. Employing individuals with intellectual disabilities is a smart business decision and a social responsibility as I told the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee in 2011, during the Committee Hearing on Improving Employment Opportunities for People with Intellectual Disabilities.

                        I have surprised my family and many others over the past thirty nine years of my life. When I was born, I don’t think that my parents imagined me as an advocate for people with intellectual disabilities. I just completed a one- year fellowship as a Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Public Policy Fellow, first on Capitol Hill with the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security and then with the National Down Syndrome Society (NDSS). It is an honor and a privilege to have been selected as the first person with an intellectual disability to serve in this position.
                        
                        My employment story started early in my life, and it took many years to prepare. I believe that inclusion starts at home. In my family, I was taught that work is part of life. Early on, I helped with family chores, and I was not excused because of my disability. Later on, I learned more about work in high school with an internship at the National Wild Life Federation and at the Davis Career Center. In 1996, I got my first internship at Booz Allen Hamilton through the “Bridges Program” sponsored by the Marriott Foundation, which encourages employers to hire interns with an intellectual disability so they can explore job opportunities.
                        
                        Once my internship ended, I was hired as an employee and have worked in the distribution center for almost 20 years. My first supervisor was great; she took it upon herself to teach me everything there was to know about being a clerk. She believed in me and she wanted me to succeed as a staff employee. At work, I am treated like other employees. The company cares about my personal and professional development. I am “one of them and not one among them.”. I am empowered to contribute.
                        
                        Promoting careers for people like me is very important and worth our time and attention. We need to move away from low expectations and start hiring people with Down syndrome and other intellectual disabilities. Why, in 2016, aren’t there more integrated competitive employment opportunities for people like me?
                        
                        I am proud to have a job and I am thankful that all of my employers, Booz Allen Hamilton, CBRE, and currently SourceAmerica, pay me competitive wages, give me full benefits, and include me on the team. I moved from a clerk position to a career of advocacy. Having Down syndrome does not define me as a person. People with disabilities want to be accepted and given an opportunity to succeed like anyone else. People with disabilities are citizens that matter. We are ready and able to work. I pay taxes, I vote, and I matter. Employment is about dignity and inclusion.</p>
