                <h4>Exercise: Obstacle Course Walking</h4>
                <h5>Instructions</h5>
                <p>
                    1. Set up an obstacle course in a safe, open area with items like cones, small hurdles, or even cushions placed on the ground. <br> <br>
                    2. Start with simple obstacles placed at varying distances apart. <br> <br>
                    3. Guide the individual to walk through the course, emphasizing proper gait mechanics such as heel-to-toe movement, swinging of arms, and maintaining balance. <br> <br>
                    4. Encourage the individual to step over or around obstacles, adapting their stride and pace as needed. <br> <br>
                    5. Gradually increase the complexity of the course by adding more obstacles or arranging them in challenging patterns. <br> <br>
                    6. Provide verbal cues and feedback on posture, balance, and coordination throughout the exercise. <br> <br>
                    7. Aim for multiple repetitions of walking through the course, gradually improving speed and confidence. <br> <br>
                    8. Modify the course based on the individual's progress and abilities, always prioritizing safety and proper form.

                    4. Find a focal point in front of you to help maintain balance and focus your gaze on it.
                    <br> <br> 5. Engage your core muscles to help stabilize your body.
                    <br> <br> 6. Hold this position for as long as you can maintain your balance, aiming for at least 10-20 seconds.
                    <br> <br>7.If you lose your balance, gently place the lifted foot back on the ground and try again. <br> <br>
                    8. Repeat the exercise on the opposite leg, focusing on maintaining good posture and stability throughout.
                    <br> <br>9. Gradually increase the duration of each hold as you become more comfortable with the exercise. <br> <br>
                    10. Aim for 2-3 sets of 3-5 repetitions on each leg, gradually increasing the duration of each hold as your balance improves.

                <h4>Exercise: Working Memory Game</h4>
                <h5>Instructions</h5>
                <p>
                    1. Gather a set of matching pairs of cards or objects (e.g., playing cards, picture cards, or even small household items). <br> <br>
                    2. Shuffle the cards and lay them face down in a grid pattern on a table or flat surface.<br> <br>
                    3. The player begins by flipping over two cards, trying to find a matching pair. <br> <br>
                    4. If the cards match, the player keeps them and gets another turn.<br> <br>
                    5. If the cards do not match, they are flipped face down again, and it's the next player's turn.<br> <br>
                    6. Players take turns flipping over pairs of cards until all matches have been found. <br> <br>
                    7. The player with the most matches at the end of the game wins.
